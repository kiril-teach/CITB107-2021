/*
Write a program that first reads VAT rate as percentage (e.g. 20) from the standard input stream (aka stdin). Than the program should read prices from the stdin (until the end of the stream) and outputs the net amount and tax amount for each tax on a new line.

Use the following formula:
net = price / (1 + rate)
tax = net * rate

Format the numbers with fixed precision using two decimal places, i.e. 0.50.

Input:
20
19.5
18
3


Output:
16.25 3.25
15.00 3.00
2.50 0.50
